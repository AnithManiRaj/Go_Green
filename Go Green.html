        <h2>Importance of Plants</h2>
        <p>
            Plants play a crucial role in our environment. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, making the air we breathe cleaner and healthier. Additionally, plants provide habitat and food for various wildlife species.
        </p>
        <p>
            By planting more trees and nurturing green spaces, we can contribute to a healthier planet and combat climate change.

            Soil is a precious resource that sustains life on Earth. It supports plant growth, filters water, and stores essential nutrients. Healthy soil is crucial for agriculture and food production.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's essential to protect and conserve our soil by practicing sustainable farming methods and reducing soil erosion.
